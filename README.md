# FitMyMenu

An app that deals with the subject of food will already archive on it what it has and what its capabilities are
the First of all you should know that I used a phpmyadmin database which has all the tables in the image and a folder 
of images that contain all the packet images.


My app is about food, choosing dishes and preparing them, the app will be implemented on smartphones in the android environment.
The application will be displayed in English with a varied and wide graphic design. 
Nowadays there is a wide range of successful apps that deal with sharing tools called social networks 
they share photos videos and statuses but to my knowledge I have not come across an app that is dedicated to sharing tools in food 
matters sharing of menu dishes ways to prepare photos more ....
 
In order to use the app, the user must log in if there is an existing user and if he does not have to register through it. 
Page and see dishes that interest him in addition to each dish will be shown how many people added by her how many ingredients
it contains and how to prepare plus image of course after interest him click the button Add to menu and prepare the dish added and his total calories updated 
can always go to the menu page where all dishes will be displayed Who added and can read about them more conveniently 
and how to prepare of course he can delete certain dishes if he is not interested in them and again the total calories will be updated.
If the user has prepared a dose that he wants to share, 
he can click on the Add dose button where he will have to fill in details plus a photo to take or a selection and all the information 
will be sent for final approval by the admin. The user will receive a final confirmation message. 
The user will always be able to access and change the parameters on it like emotional weight and food style.
